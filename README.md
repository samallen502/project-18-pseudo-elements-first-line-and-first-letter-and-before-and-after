This exercise shows how you can add to HTML and style HTML from CSS using the following pseudo-elements:
1. ::first-line
2. ::first-letter
3. ::before
4. ::after

Pseudo-elements can help you maintain cleaner HTML.  (You also might not have permissions to edit HTML, so pseudo-elements can help in that regard, too.)

See style.css for specific examples and additional comments.
